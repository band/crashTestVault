# Untitled and yet - notes  
- but it will not remain untitled, or maybe it will

### 2024-03-29:
- seems like sub-dirs are not filtered from the file listing; yeah, that was some holdover from who knows where or what
- there is a bug when the parentPath is `/`; need to handle that better, maybe in a more general way
- maybe? || maybe not?
- when tired writing code takes more time  

**TODO**:  
 - review the console.log messages  
 - figure out the remaining code and delete what is not relevant  
 - figure out how to trigger building the contents file -- and --
 - put the code in place and test, test, test  

### 2025-04-04:
- implemented suggested Claude code changes; any difference?
- seems to rewrite the index continuously; how to slow that down?  

### 2025-04-05:
-  Claude code is not worth the money; using Anthropic API seems to give better results.
