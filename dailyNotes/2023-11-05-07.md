Continuing to work on building link indexes for specific folders.

But, today, for some reason, I am getting an `mwb` failure that looks like a file not committed to `git` ....

Hmmm ....

Aha: and the culprit is the index file, because it is currently `.gitignore`d ...

so one possible solution is to craft a local (to my wiki) `git push` script that builds and then pushes the index files so that when they are swept up by `mwb` for the `all-pages` list there is a `git` log for them. this way `mwb.py` can be the same for everyone.  

another alternative is to write a the folder index i want as an Obsidian plug-in?

#### 2023-11-07:  
- installed FolderIndex plug-in  
- and after a few trials, un-installed it and deleted the index files (they seemed to be a mess of nested links)
- TODO: document purpose of folder indices or MOCs or whatever they are called.
