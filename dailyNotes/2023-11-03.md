Trying out the plugin "Folder notes":  
- each and every one of these things do not seem to behave the way I expect them to
- this i attribute to some preconceived notions, a.k.a., expectations
- maybe i can sort that out and keep notes here  
- where are the effin' folder notes? this is so confusing. gah!  
- - what a mess; my terminology for what i want seems to be entirely different from what Obsidian folks use. gah!
