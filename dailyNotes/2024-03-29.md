- somehow i think this plugin code is going to get much simpler
- of course, there seems to be no way to know if changing file content is yielding any kind of event ....
- hmmm ... wait! modifying this file did trigger that event for every change being made, but the conditional statement in the code is not being run
- it is a bit of fun figuring out how this works by pushing buttons ....
- who's your parent? and is it just "/"?
