- what a mess; my terminology for what i want seems to be entirely different from what Obsidian folks use. gah!  


### 2024-03-26:
 - okay; i did it myself, or at least part of it  
 - some TS notes:
	 - need to better understand the sync / async diffs for folder indexing
	 - want to find good ways of expressing list processing such as sorting, and file processing by modification times
	 - also: how can a plugin notice that directory contents have changed

### 2024-03-28:

- yeah, there is more work to do on that one-liner (ha, ha)
