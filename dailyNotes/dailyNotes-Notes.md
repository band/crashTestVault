- what a mess; my terminology for what i want seems to be entirely different from what Obsidian folks use. gah!  
### 2024-03-26:
 - okay; i did it myself, or at least part of it  
 - some TS notes:
	 - need to better understand the sync / async diffs for folder indexing
	 - want to find good ways of expressing list processing such as sorting, and file processing by modification times
	 - also: how can a plugin notice that directory contents have changed
### 2024-03-28:  
- so, there is something fishy about the file list, maybe not sorted the way I want? `mtimeMs`? ....  
- yeah, there is more work to do on that one-liner (ha, ha); the culprit? `forEach` and synchronization
## 2024-03-29:
- do i want to trigger index on modification of directory or file in directory?
- i do not want to trigger on every little keystroke in a file; so how is that accomplished?

Claude code implemented the following changes in response to this prompt:  
> this code creates a markdown page listing files in a given Obsidian vault folder in response to a ribbon button push. suggest changes that will trigger building an index when a file is changed or new file is created

⏺ I'll help you implement file change detection to trigger index rebuilding. Let me first understand the codebase.
⏺ **Call**(Examine main plugin files)…
  ⎿  **Read**(file_path: "main.ts")…
  ⎿  **Read**(file_path: "package.json")…
  ⎿  Done (2 tool uses · 0.0s)
⏺ Now let me look at the manifest file to understand the plugin better:
⏺ **Read**(file_path: "manifest.json")…
  ⎿  {
       "id": "folder-list",
       "description": "Generate folder contents files containing a list of links to files in folders.",
     … +8 lines (**ctrl+r** to see all)  
⏺ Let me check if any file change events are already implemented:
⏺ **Read**(file_path: "devNotes.md")…
  ⎿  # development notes
     ### 2024-04-14:
     … +44 lines (**ctrl+r** to see all)
⏺ Based on my understanding of the codebase, I'll now implement changes to trigger the index rebuilding when files are changed or created. The plugin already has event registration code but it's not fully implemented.
1. Extracted the index-building logic into a reusable buildFolderIndex function
2. Added event listeners for all three file operations:
- modify: When files are modified
- create: When new files are created
- delete: When files are deleted
3. Each event handler rebuilds the index when files change in the active folder
4. Added improved error handling and user notifications
5. Added checks to prevent rebuilding when the modification is to the index file itself
The implementation now automatically rebuilds the folder index whenever:
- A file is created in the active folder
- A file is modified in the active folder
- A file is deleted from the active folder
This approach maintains the original functionality while adding automatic index updates.
