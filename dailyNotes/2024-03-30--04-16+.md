### 2024-03-30

- need to finish figuring out how to get, set, and use the omittedPaths information

### 2024-04-15
- today's learnings:
	- how to save the `omittedFolders` data collected on the settings tab
	- and how to not index folders that are on that list
- next steps: cleanup `omittedFolders` so that trailing slashes are trimmed from what is input on the settings tab

### 2024-04-16
- today's learnings:
	- figured out how to strip the '/' characters from the `omittedFolders` list

### 2024-04-17
- today's learnings:
	- gaining understanding of the uses of `map`  
	- have a view of object.method composition as a reverse functional notation
- today's plan: maybe reverse `omittedFolders` to be the list of folders to index
- one remaining operation of folder indexing is determining how and when to trigger it

### 2024-04-23
- today's learnings:
	- building a release using Github Actions
	- still working on understanding how to use BRAT
	- but now let's see if the release code works

### 2024-04-16
- today: we are so confused; but do need to read the code
