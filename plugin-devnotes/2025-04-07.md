a note for today;

and a test of what happens to the index when a new note is added,
and, then, when it is deleted

well, when the last file is moved out of directory, the idx- file remains. i am not thinking this out very well.

i want:

1. idx- file rebuilt every time there is a modification to a file in the directory (including deletion of a file) or creation of a new file in the directory (and also when the ribbon button is pushed?)  
2. any existing idx- file to be deleted when the last ".md" file is deleted  

another test file: [[2025-04-08]]  


now if we add something new on 2025-04-17; what happens?
