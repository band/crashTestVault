going back to the older code; but still wondering how things work; especially on create a new file and delete an existing file

### 2025-04-18  
still a bit of confusion with what gets updated when and how to avoid recursion on the index file and still update the index file.  

thinking about using the ribbon button to force rebuild of activeFile indices? maybe all indices?
