a duplicate file

- as we blithely inspect VSCode errors and accept the Copilot generated solutions, what are we learning about Typescript and Copilot?
- kinda fun to have Copilot review the code, but I am not sure I am learning enough about Typescript with every suggestion  

yeah; well a lot of Copilot updates;  
maybe we have mostly Obsidian API calls?  

need to re-read this code (but not in VSC - ugh)  
and maybe read some docs, or use Claude?

- all sorts of errors now on and 'idx-.md' file. yikes!

### 2025 -04-14  
- still not sure how to make changes to this code (might stay away from VSC for awhile)
