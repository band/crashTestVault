- today's dev note is: yikes! i need to start all over again. this particular plug-in, while it might do what i want, is incomprehensible, and needs to be rewritten with some idea of how to write a maintainable Obsidian plugin.
- maybe start again with the "Recent Files" plugin?
Gah!

- first, let's figure out debug logging ....
- usually the error messages reveal the problem, if i know what i am looking at

- OK; maybe set up logging; must check
- also the deBounceTimer thing needs checking
- slowed the deBounceTimer to 5 seconds; maybe that is an improvement
- 5 seconds seems like a long time; 2 seconds seems too short;  
- what about 3 seconds?

TODO: sort out build and index for every directory not specified, or only for specified directories?  

TODO: still need to sort out the console log messages between debug and just some runtime info  

- okay; the settings "debug" tab works.
