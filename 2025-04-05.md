the daily note for today

and the good news is that the index file is created when non-existent

refactoring; but we have errors


file path errors 
index file path errors

found the error, but now it needs to be fixed

and we have another error; yay!

read the code bill
well this code is just a bit of a mystery
cleaning the code up a wee bit

more testing - seems ok for now
sanitized path seems ok
logging looks like a lift

### 2025-04-15  
- this code looks nice, but still hard to understand the fileEvents in Obsidian
