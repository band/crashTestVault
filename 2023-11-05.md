Continuing to work on building link indexes for specific folders.

But, today, for some reason, I am getting an `mwb` failure that looks like a file not committed to `git` ....

Hmmm ....

Aha: and the culprit is the index file, because it is currently `.gitignore`d ...

so one possible solution is to craft a local (to my wiki) `git push` script that builds and then pushes the index files so that when they are swept up by `mwb` for the `all-pages` list there is a `git` log for them. this way `mwb.py` can be the same for everyone.  

another alternative is to write a the folder index i want as an Obsidian plug-in?
